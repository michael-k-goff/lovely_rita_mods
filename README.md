# Lovely Rita Mods

This project is an annex to Open Oakland's [Lovely Rita](https://github.com/openoakland/lovely-rita) project. The main goal is to process data on Oakland parking tickets and create an interactive map to visualize the data.

### Instructions

1. Get the clean Lovely Rita data set. You can download it directly from the [Lovely Rita](https://github.com/openoakland/lovely-rita/wiki/Data-Sources) project, or you can set up that repository and create the file.
2. Execute the lovely\_rita.py script, then run run\_full(). Be warned that it takes about 90 minutes on my machine.
3. Open ticket\_display.html in your browser.

The intermediate files needed to display the map are included in this repository, so you can skip directly to Step 3 if you just want to see the map.
